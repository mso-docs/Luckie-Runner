### Refactor Checklist

- [x] Extract per-frame pipeline into `GameSystems` orchestrator (update, stats tick, game over check, camera update) and wire `Game.onTick` to it.
- [x] Move save/load snapshot logic into `ProgressManager` wrapping `SaveService` (build/apply snapshots, slot I/O).
- [x] Shift audio UI/volume controls into `AudioController` bridging `AudioService` and DOM controls.
- [x] Push dialogue/interaction handling fully into `UIManager/DialogueManager` (start/advance/hide bubble, NPC talk), with `Game` only routing signals.
- [x] Extract test-room/reset snapshot utilities into `TestRoomManager` (or extend `ResetService`) for debug mode toggles and state restore.
- [x] Create `StatsManager` to handle enemy/item events, badges/HUD updates, and stats accumulation.
- [x] Extend factories/registries to be data-driven (pluggable builders, config-driven types).
- [x] Move UI strings into `UIConfig`; centralize dialogue formatting in `DialogueManager` and keep speech/NPC/sign dialogue routed through it.
- [ ] Add more modular render targets (multi-canvas/offscreen) using `RenderTarget` abstraction.
- [ ] Hook UI/Audio responses to event bus signals for further decoupling.
- [ ] Make the ability to go into houses (most buildings have 2 frames-- door open and door closed).
- [ ] Allow players to press Enter in front of a house to open the door and go inside
- [ ] Players can go into a room, which is a separate scene constrained to the size of an image
- [ ] Rooms feature an NPC or items, like a chest. Some can even have platforming challenges!
- [ ] Player can exit the room by clicking enter
- [ ] Town objects/lamps/etc have invisible platforms on them/collisions, like NPCs, entities
- [ ] Towns at minimum, always spawn with a shop and 2-3 houses. I also want to have custom houses in some towns
- [ ] I want complete documentation of how to build a town and level using the modular system we have. I want tech docs on how the game works and what you can do to add more levels, characters, abilities, and more.
- [ ] I want a complete guide to the UI interface and a guide of next steps for converting the UI interface completely into canvas or a javascript format. 
- [ ] I want to add the ability to throw objects at NPC characters and they get knockback. I don't want any damage, just an "ow!" sound effect and knockback
- [ ] I want the player to get the ability to ground pound using the down arrow, squashing their sprite in the process
- [ ] Set up framework for boss battles or battle screens
- [ ] Set up documentation for the projectile class, how it works, what it does and how to add new projectiles to the game
- [ ] Add abilities for the player to pick up
- [ ] Add a save block for the player to tap and save their game automatically.
